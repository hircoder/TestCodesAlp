    " This code is a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm for an interview assignment.\n",
    " I used the following resources to learn about K-means clustering algorithm:\n",
    " https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-introduction/\n",
    " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering\n",
    " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA\n",
    "\n",
    " The objective of this code is to partition a set of data points into k clusters based on their similarity, where k is a given number.\n",
    " This is done to ensure that data points within each cluster are as similar as possible and as dissimilar as possible from data points in other clusters.\n",
    " To test the code, load datasets and perform K-means clustering on the data, specifying the number of clusters and maximum iterations.\n",
    " The code assumes that the data is two-dimensional and the number of clusters is less than or equal to the number of data points.\n",
    " The code visualizes the clusters and centroids in a scatter plot and saves the plot as an image file.\n",
    " It also assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file with no header row and two columns: one for the X values and one for the Y values.\n",
    " The data is loaded from the CSV file using Pandas and converted to a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    " The implementation assumes a simple K-means algorithm, meaning that initial centroids are randomly selected from the data points.\n",
    " It also assumes the Euclidean distance is used to calculate the distance between data points and centroids.\n",
    " As stated in the assignment, the expected outputs are the final set of clusters and their corresponding centroids.\n",
    " Per the requirements, the K-means algorithm should have an interface similar to the one provided by scikit-learn.\n",
    " Based on the scikit-learn documentation, the K-means algorithm has defined methods for fitting the model and predicting cluster labels.\n",
    " Reference: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html\n",
    " I have implemented the fit and predict methods, similar to the KMeans class in scikit-learn.\n",
    " The fit method takes the data and the number of clusters as input and returns the model object.\n",
    " The predict method takes the data as input and returns the predicted cluster labels for the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    " I have tried to follow clean code practices as much as possible.\n",
    " I also added comments where they helped me understand the code better.\n",
    " To run this code:\n",
    "   1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing this file.\n",
    "   2. Run the following command: python K-means2.py <dataset_file> <n_clusters> <max_iterations>\n"
